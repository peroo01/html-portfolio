<<h1>The best movies of all time by Peter</h1>
<h2>These are my top 10 best movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Stranger things</h3>
<p>It was a really awesome watch, sci-fi mixed with horror, comedy and light-hearted fun. </p>
<h3>Ben 10</h3>
<P>This has to be my best cartoon i watched growing up, everything about it was just complete, you guys should try it.</P>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>At first I wasn't really an anime fan, but this one right here, it captured me,from the storyline to the beautiful animations, it is a must watch.</p>
<h3>Shaft</h3>
<p>If you're looking for an amazing adult centered comedy, this is for you. There was literally no point in the movie i wasn't laughing.</p>
<h3>Supa Strikas</h3>
<p>If you haven't watched this at all,like what happened to your television while growing up?<br/>Everyone knows about Shegss, El-matador and the whole team.</p>
<h3>Shingeku No Kyojin</h3>
<p>Like C'mon, you haven't watched AOT yet, you are missing out on a lot bro.<br/>P.s: If you are one of those lameahh niggas who think not atching anime is a flex, well am deeply sorry for you.</p>
<h3>Moana</h3>
<p>I think this is most especially for the girls in the house,this is just the animation you want to get into, with the songs and the animations and of course our disney princess Moana, this is the one for you.</p>
